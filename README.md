# CODECRAFT_DS_01
# Task 1 of my Data Analysis internship (Interactive Dashboard Creation using MS Excel)

# Project Objective
- To create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the heart attack likelihood in India based on factors such as age, gender and region.

# Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/deepti-chaudhary/CODECRAFT_DS_01/blob/main/heart_attack_youngsters_india.xlsx">Dataset</a>

# Questions (KPIs)
- Compare the age and heart attack likelihood using a column chart.
- Difference in heart attack likelihood of different ages.
- Are teenagers more or less prone to having a heart attack than seniors?
- Age with highest likelihood of heart attack has more of - Male or Female?
- Distribution of heart attack likelihood in different regions of India using a column chart.
- Which region contains individuals with less likelihood of a heart attack?
- Distribution of heart attack likelihood by gender using a chart.
- Which gender is more likely to have a heart attack?
- Is there any difference or not?

# Process
- Verify the data for any error , anomalies or missing value and sort them out.
- Created pivot tables and pivot charts according to the questions mentioned above.
- Merged all the charts in one dashboard and applied slicers for dynamic interactive analysis.

# Project Insight
- Negligible difference in heart attack likelihood between Male and Female.
- Central and North regions of India have the highest heart attack prone individuals.
- Seniors(age 30-35) have higher likelihood of heart attack than people with age 18-29.
- The most heart attack prone age is 32.
- 32 aged individuals with highest likelihood of heart attack contains more females than males.
- North-east region of India is least prone to heart attack.

# Final Conclusion
- Individuals with highest physical activity have lowest cholesterol level. Lowest cholesterol level individuals are least likely to have a heart attack. Therefore, to improve the chances of not getting a heart attack, individuals should be involved in physical activities as much as possible.
